Description: The prolfqua package integrates essential steps
    of the mass spectrometry based label free quantification data
    analysis workflow: quality control, data normalization, protein aggregation,
    modeling, hypothesis testing and sample size estimation.
    We use prolfqua to develop highly customizable, visually appealing,
    and interactive data analysis reports in pdf or HTML format.
    We use prolfqua to visualize and model simple experimental designs
    with a single explanatory variable and complex experiments with multiple factors.
    Furthermore, we use prolfqua to benchmark data acquisition,
    data preprocessing or data modeling methods.
    We developed and improved the package by applying the "Eating your own dog food" principle, making it easy to use.
