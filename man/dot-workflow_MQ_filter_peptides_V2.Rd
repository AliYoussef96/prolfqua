\title{Keep only those proteins with 2 IDENTIFIED peptides. remove peptides with NA's only in one condition.
This filtering was implemented to prevent models from failing to fit. Now deprecated.
Will not work with mixed effect models which model peptide level data (and require 2 or more peptides per protein).}
