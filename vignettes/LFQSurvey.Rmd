# Introduction

## Goal

- Save time 
- Improve quality of services
- Ensure reproducibility

## How?

- A 15-30 min meeting where the client and bioinformatician exchange information to fill out a predefined form (survey).

# Motivation

Hooray!! Data is measured! Can you analyse the data?

- Where is the sample annotation? File names?
- How to name factors? Could you rerun the analysis. It should be `mutation` not `background`! 
- What hypothesis should be tested? Oh, actually I need `cl - tr` and not `tr - cl`!
- Can you do this because your colleague said it is OK?
- Was it a repeated measurement? Yes indeed! Sorry could you remake the analysis?
- Could you please add this sequence to the database and rerun everything?

# Motivation

Information extracted in little bits. For service projects you will likely find most of it in the b-fabric comments.

- but was it project or order comment?
- how much more often do I have to click the _more_ button until I find it?

# Aim of meeting

- Keep it short (15-30 minutes)!
- Give guidance
- Get only the information you need to perform an __Analysis per protocol__
- Minimize changes and updates


# Aim of meeting

## Document

- which protein database to use
- which and how many samples to use for the QC
- collect all the parameters for sample size estimation
- understand the design of the main experiment
- document all the names of the factors and factor levels
- specify the hypothesis to be tested


# Conclusion

- Tested it with Paolo and with 2 clients
- Helps not to forget important points
- Survey still evolving


# TPF update

- QC and sample size estimation
- Hypothesis testing using linear models
- GSEA and ORA analysis
