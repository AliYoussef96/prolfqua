# Introduction

Agenda for project kickoff meeting - bioinformatics part.

## Goal

- Save time 
- Improve quality of services
- Ensure reproducibility

## How?

- Keep it short (15-30 minutes)!
- Follow an agenda
- Give _statistical_ guidance
- Get the information you need to perform an __Analysis per protocol__


# Motivation

Incomplete information causes that analysis is delayed or has to be redone.

Information extracted in little bits. For service projects you likely find most in the b-fabric comments.

- but was it project or order comment?
- how often do I have to click the _more_ button until I find the comment?


# Aim of meeting

## Document

- which protein database to use
- which and how many samples to use for the QC
- collect all the parameters for sample size estimation
- understand the design of the main experiment
- document all the names of the factors and factor levels
- specify the hypothesis to be tested


# Conclusion

- Helps to prepare for meeting
- Focuses and streamlines discussion
- Tested on a few projects
- Agenda still evolving

# TPF update

TPF - technology platform fund (50k)

To improve LFQ data analysis and reporting.


$\approx 8k$ spend on Lucas Kook, $\approx 12k$ on JG, $\approx 30k$ still available.

# TPF update

- QC and sample size estimation
- Hypothesis testing using linear models
- GSEA and ORA analysis

# Outlook

- b-fabric integration.
- Improve sample size estimation report (make it interactive).
- Alternative normalization, aggregations, models etc.
- More model diagnostics.
- Improving table formatting and data visualization.
- more downstream analysis.
